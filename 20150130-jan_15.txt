So with January pretty much done, I thought I would do a summary of it.

I think the biggest thing is I have started to take Japanese Lessons. It's quite a nice group and helps that it's far cheaper than having to travel to London for lessons. Its on Friday nights and I travel on the train straight from Work in Wickford to Southend and then it's a brisk walk to the building to make it on time. So far I have only had one full lesson, since I managed to get on the wrong train that didn't go anywhere near Southend and ended up in a place called Althorne which was a weird place:

So far the lessons have been trying to remember the Hiragana by reading, writing and saying them out loud. I like to think I'm making good progress but I'm struggling to get back into the mindset to learn which was something I lost a number of years ago. Hopefully I can continue to get better at it.

Aside from that Work has been more eventful then ever. I'm interacting more with customers and doing more exciting work. My two main projects have been to make a site responsive and then to integrate Shopify with our CMS. Finishing the month a lot better than it started with a customer cancelling since there was an apparent deadline I didn't know about, but oh well, stuff like that happens I guess.

On the hobby front, I'm more into Dempagumi inc. then before and I have also got a friend into Momoclo and Dempagumi so that's very exciting. I'm also trying to expand a tad more with Ebichu & BiS and more conventional music like 岡村靖幸 & Silent Siren. Me, him and another friend should hopefully be planning our trip to Japan next year within the next few weeks so I'm looking forward to that immensely.

With personal webdev projects, the Doujin Release Tracker had C87 data added but I lacked a lot of motivation to actually add releases to it so for the next version I either want to make it editable by anyone or for it to just work with a scraper to auto get the content. I do want to start a big project though. I want to have it use an API that other people can use and use Unit Testing and built with new technologies but I'm still working on the idea for it. Currently thinking the Doujin Release Tracker might be the best thing to use for the project.

Anyhow, that's probably about it for January. For Feb, I don't really have a lot of plans. There is a bunch of new music out which I'm importing but they won't get here til March probably.
