title: 2014 A Year in Review
date: 28th December 2014

Oho, so it's been 8 months since the last blog post but I want to make another commitment to the blog and getting organised this year. To start off with I think I'll do a post analysing the year as a whole and the goals I have achieved.

So firstly lets look back at my post about what I expected 2014 to bring: [A New Year - 2014](http://blog.tomo.pagu.co/post/73150242994/a-new-year-2014)

So 2014 has had it's up and downs like any other year but on the whole I believe 2014 to have been an overall positive year. It's been lonelier but generally I've been more active and happier for working rather than being lazy.

The band still haven't progressed from the stage we were at last year, we haven't had a practice all year and I don't think I've spoken to any of the guys about the band so we can assume that this is definitely dead. Me and my sister do have plans to start our own group, but I only know the drums and she only sings so we're at a bit of predicament right now. We have now converted the garage into a makeshift studio so we just have to learn some music composition and software and come up with some ideas for songs. We kinda know the direction we want to go in already which is nice though.

I mentioned Goals for 2014 in that post and I'll list them again here:

### Save Money
So while I didn't save money per say since I ended up importing a lot I was able (with some help from my grandmother) able to go to Japan in September. I'll talk more about that in a separate post. But do I think I was able to Save Money? No.

### Learn Japanese
No. I bought books, installed apps, tried writing but I could never keep up with anything.

### Become a better WebDev
While I didn't really learn a new web language I like to think I have become a better web dev. I'm doing more projects than before and while they're typically Angular based I have dabbled in Laravel & Meteor. Hopefully next year I can try more projects using them or even some different projects.

### More Friends
I would say this has been kinda achieved. While I don't post on 4chan/Reddit as much as I wanted too, I have been fairly active on IRC and made a few friends on there. I'm also meeting new people on twitter and recently applied to help out with a fan run Manga Translation site purely for Vocaloid Manga. So I definitely think I have become more confident this year.

### Make Music
Covered above with the band stuff really. I purchased Logic, a mini-keyboard and have helped change the garage into a mini studio but as of yet nothing has happened.

## Epilogue
So with my goals not really being completed can I count 2014 as a successful year. Probably not, but it's definitely a year to remember.
