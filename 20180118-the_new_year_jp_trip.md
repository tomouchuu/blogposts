title: The new year JP trip
date: 18th January 2019
---

Hey! It's been a while since my last post. In 2018 I went to Japan a record 4 times but today I'd like to focus on just the last one which took place over new years and ran til the 9th. Let's start off from landing on the 31st.

### A bad new years

My nose hurt from the plane journey, it seemingly took forever for my luggage to come through and then the luggage was searched at customs so not the greatest start to a JP trip. Admittely though, the guy who searched my bag was really nice, called me nintendo kid cause I was wearing the nintendo joggers and then when he saw the penlights he was really suprised and asked what group. Suprisingly he knew Dempagumi and was a Moga oshi!

Once through that and picking up wifi I finally got out of the airport and headed to Akiba. Dropping off luggage I pretty much just hung in an arcade til I could get back to hotel to check in. Once done I got into my capsule, watched kohaku and deliberated about where to spend new years. Options included Mogra for some good music, Shibuya for atmosphere & Odaiba for fireworks and good view. I decided on Odaiba as kz(livetune) wasn't at Mogra and was worried it was too busy to enjoy Shibuya.

Arriving at Odaiba, there were people around so I assumed there would be some sort of event going on. However after waiting in the cold with a not bad view for around an hour, we hit midnight! ![My view at Odaiba](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvwFSdIVAAA_6GJ.jpg)

To celebrate midnight, the Rainbow Bridge changed colour and we had one green firework launch to the very right of my view. Also there were a few boat horns sounding. That was it, and I was super disappointed. Waiting there for another 15mins just to be sure, I decided to head back to Akiba. Hopefully I wouldn't get let down by cocoichi. Thankfully they were still open at like 1am! So I got to have a good meal ![Happy New Year @ Cocoichi](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvwhM3_V4AEiUEI.jpg)

For new year's day, I woke at 12:37pm and caught the Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom fireworks for new year and then spent the day in arcades.

### NPP!

NPP started pretty badly too! I couldn't really sleep but managed to wake up in time for when I wanted to leave. I got to Odaiba a bit before tickets became available to pick up so I could grab that as soon as possible and then make my way into the merch line to try grab a Nijicon prayer plate thing. Unfortuntately they sold out like maybe 1 or 2 people before me which sucked majorly. I still managed to pick up the CD/DVD so that at least got me a signed cheki with Ao later.

I then grabbed a starbucks hot choccolate and met with some friends before entering Zepp Divercity. Here we caught FES☆TIVE and Ange☆Reve before the main event (for me anyway) of Nijicon. You can catch their live here: https://youtu.be/cuHhkHRdxhQ.

From here me and one of the guys left to go to the other stage. I wanted to catch the collab event for more nijicon which was in a few hours so in the mean time we caught: 絶対直球女子！プレイボールズ & アメフラっシ. For the collabs it was アップアップガールズ(仮) × あゆみくりかまき、神宿 × CROWN POP、Nijicon × マジカル・パンチライン. The nijicon one being the highlight for me! At this point the friend had left so I ventured back to the Divercity area and went to arcade to pass some time til the nijicon rewards. Finally at this point, I queued and in the line met a guy who I kept bumping into at Nijicon lives. After having a good photo with Ao ![Good New Year Ao](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dv8Rs_qVYAAsJWZ.jpg) we met up and went to the talk show for Nijicon where we saw a few little idol groups like PiMiX and BANZAI JAPAN (who I'd missed seeing at HyperJapan). Then it was time for the Talk Show where Nijicon announced their dream for the year would be a Zepp one-man, I hope they can achieve it!

After the talk show we decided to get some food, my choice! So we set off for cocoichi back in Akiba. Here we got beer and talked about nijicon and idols, it was really nice. I still can't really speak Japanese and friend can't really speak English but we somehow managed to make it work, I was really happy!

For Day 2 of NPP, I got to have a lie in as already got my wristband and wasn't any merch that I desparately wanted. I would mostly be at Zepp Tokyo which was the venue a bit out of the way so got there around 10:30 to catch Banmon and uijin from there I then got merch for uijin, CY8ER and Dance for Philosophy. Then I trekked back to Divercity for food and arcades before the CY8ER rewards to see Rinahamu before heading back to Zepp Tokyo for the Collabs, the main ones here were uijin x THERE THERE THERES and 大阪☆春夏秋冬 × Dance for Philosophy, the sora tob sakana × つりビット collab was nice too. Straight after that was Dance for Philosophy's main live which was good fun then a trek back to Divercity for the uijin reward which was great cause hitochibi was in the collab costume and then seeing mariri after that from dance for philosophy. Finally after all that I could head back to hotel for some rest.

### To Saitama!

For the 4th I had nothing originally planned but then Nijicon announced a release event in Saitama. I'd never been there and it was in the community section of the super arena so I wanted to check that out! I got there pretty early and also began a search for a ticket machine that I could use to get a ticket for a festival on the 6th. It took quite a while and eventually I could have just used a machine in the first 7/11 I went into. After that I found a queue for the Winter Sports Fiesta and didn't make the connection that this was the event nijicon were at skipped this and went looking for another queue before I made the connection. It was no bother though as I didn't want the blu-ray since Ao wasn't going to be there. Instead another cd/dvd and I'd use the 4tickets I'd get for 2 random smart phone photo/random chekis and then last 2 for a cheki with Chance. Their live was a ton of fun and I pulled a really good number so was front row to the far corner. In the end I opted for 2 smartphone photos and pulled Airi and Miyuu which was not bad I guess but would love to get a rikopin picture at some point. The chance cheki was nice, she remembered me (staff did too) as the Ao guy.

After here I went to a local Saizeriya for some pizza and beer before heading back to the hotel.
