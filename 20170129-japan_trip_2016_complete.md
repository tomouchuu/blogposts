title: Japan Trip 2016
date: 29th January 2017
---
So just under 2 years since I last visited I was heading back to Japan. Like last time I was going for music concerts, though rather than rock/pop concerts it would be purely idol concerts with Tokyo Idol Festival, PassCode, Dempagumi.inc & Momoiro Clover Z over the 10 days. Anyway let’s begin this blog post from the day of my flight.

## Day 0
I did a small vlog on the morning I was leaving which you can find here:

To sum it up, I’d be driving to the local Park + Ride and getting a bus into town and then getting a train into Stratford switching onto the DLR to London City Airport. The automatic bag drop didn’t really work and I was there a good hour before I could do anything so bought the new Harry Potter book (which I’m still yet to read) and waited until I could do the bag drop. There was a little bit of confusion with where my bags were to go but was sorted as they could get them to Narita. After getting through security and sitting for a while in a rather busy departure lounge waiting for my gate to be ready, I could finally board my flight to Frankfurt. 

The flight to Frankfurt was actually really nice. For someone who doesn’t enjoy planes the trip seemed over really quickly and I got some nice shots of London as we were taking off [https://goo.gl/photos/xqeWsrPKR7Cwd4E3A](https://goo.gl/photos/xqeWsrPKR7Cwd4E3A). Frankfurt was pretty dreary on landing and very empty

I needed a boarding pass for my Japan Airlines flight to Narita and wasn’t sure whether I’d need to head out of the departure lounges through security to the JAL checkin and then back through security to the gate. Confirming this I asked at the JAL Sakura Lounge what I needed to do and thankfully they were able to get my boarding pass directly there which was fantastic as it meant I could stay air-side until my gate was ready. An hour later it was and I boarded my JAL flight to Narita.

## Day 1
I landed in Narita early at around 1pm. As expected I went through immigrations & customs really quickly so waited around at the airport for a while before picking up my rail pass and booking my seat into Tokyo. I found a McDonalds and ordered 2 hamburgers, 15 chicken nuggets and a coke, they forgot the hamburgers but oh well. It was a nice empty train into Tokyo and I changed from there onto the Yamanote line to Hamamatsucho and walked 10mins or so in the heat and hearing nothing but cicadas reached my Apartment. I was a little downbeat after seeing it for the first time since I had only been used to hotel rooms as it was the first time I had used AirBnb, but I eventually came to really like it.

After getting settled I headed over to Odaiba as I wanted to see the stages for Tokyo Idol Festival, play some SDVX at the Round1 Stadium at DiverCity, get my DisneySea ticket & have some food. After checking my balance on my mananca from the last trip I was on my way. First stop was the DisneyStore to get my DisneySea ticket for later in the trip and then from there went looking around the TIF stages. I went over to the Smile Garden stage and made a quick vlog though you can barely hear me over the cicadas: [https://goo.gl/photos/FTi7W861JSaEHfM98](https://goo.gl/photos/FTi7W861JSaEHfM98).

From here I headed to DiverCity, played some Sound Voltex, checked out the Village Vanguard and ate at a really nice pizza place (even though they forgot my coffee). After that I headed back to the apartment to sleep.

## Day 2
Disaster, I overslept by 4 hours, missing some groups I wanted to see however I managed to get there in time for You’ll Melt More & Band Ja Nai Mon at the Hot Stage in Zepp Divercity. There I met up with my friend Riku and he introduced me to his friends. He & his friend had some spare handshake tickets and so I bought those off them and then headed straight for the cheki with gumi as she was going to be separate from the rest of the group as she was going to be in the fashion show when they were at the greeting area. After a little bit of waiting I was able to meet gumi and get a cheki, while I couldn’t talk very well and there was a big line so I just said hello and got my cheki. It came out really white:

![Cheki with Gumi from Banmon](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rcpXYnRpqDPnn_ELiYKffrz8J05BJyZFn0K5QciV2kqNQqqIn3PEAPTdbmAhEmfA09g2U-dOoDy7-KLjfLu0_7xDLbkvA9oXcKj_r1dFSxi9SkVdc7vEtZdzzQkG7lAvV5SwjmjRPDy9SaJLWef-VGMvZF3sqUu3NlSrc03seszfWQqJxQd-3-WunElxflJ-Ax4lEk_fj2RLFte2yqchu86Tz-9i4a7uo63C1HCyeeDPeC0e_60DnrfHk5hYWkjFgMSRGsyBpXC6zF9_W1iVXeIKoSbMvu-tEZ9Di4kQ_qgaJAiEIJEDR8mOa1VwLJq82MqzmA2vo38DrOq0HbBsYBrMowio3K_2Z8FDSYgMUNEMgD1Lc4TAvmIyYlixFus6QtCHR6PYfwLUWSgUJAJeFGCQGQDEG4ybuG1me7t_LqnXgFXvc-2iTcHtxo_3ZJvjlM0LuI139EKJHmwOv5JxPqCi98QE3RgzZZTJmXSEPLyFFkwKp8LAjBxAM2HQ74xDLgcFqrCO1pzXTl_NWSYBhzVsRmV2XlMAYwFrgEZT_ixd0L6WredIAafgOpdMtsA-iuQTQ7AFMEnvMjbmAtw4LETVI4Wsm5HnG-lUvJAivsRIqGao=w882-h1566-no)

I then went to catch a bit of Stereo Japan at the Smile Garden stage before heading back to the greeting area for handshake with the rest of the banmon girls.

Meeting back up with Riku & his friend they were excited about my cheki and when I showed them they called over one of their staff members and asked if it would be possible to swap on the sunday. The banmon staff member said it was ok to do which was great as I’d get another chance to meet her. They went off for their handshakes with their oshis and after 20mins or so they switched from chekis to handshakes. With Riku behind me I did the handshake saying hello (in english as I was a bit starstruck) which I think suprised and amazed them that a foreign fan was interested in them. I was happy that I was able to do the handshake and they really put in an effort to talk to me. It was funny when I came out the handshake line and Riku behind me was a little mad that I was taking all the attention as they asked him if I was a friend of his (he is really well known by the group) so he couldn’t talk to them about what he wanted. After that we stuck around their area where they made some announcements and they left after that.

From there me and Riku went to get food where we spotted a DeLorean from Back to the Future

![DeLorean](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vcEa_ufdWxyJ00NYIGNilXZ070ClKMT7BuO3i4-vkiwVLNfxM_sEsz8wxgfpcaDqEqtfCeXGes7SZNbP5d7ut0DuMeyCVep7AeCaMqRh5E4r3if-m-g1Rx3f1gdz5UQrUQrH2vnQQNUU96p99-lRBdKf3L-CL_WlFSrb2MdWHQ5TNwn5smYJCTYwAMvaAUlr2GJNXvIS4vZNH8a8iAkkWI-Bm0ZkdU1C0p4JSC8-0ukY7E70iJPIHgZbFXiT7lzM-ekPTzNyy3NMEsUdnGs1s5JUDLCUIZlb1I23ZZWj2pAsprQYTeJaOZGK0LreZj1bSVSV-7x7vcGPKrHut0-1-NCgGhfaT2UG4VVH_STJSElOWa52o7AoPCFDuk47F3aQHMIj0m-GQ4mQvz2SYpJg0UmOqjP4x2ZBwgLHc8EsgdYhqyyQspTSp9DPkr8Zy2DTahvLScmOT1w3OU8O09bbCq00v8TGRRDvmzq-INTRlu70ak_focc1iYeE8T1hMtVQe2zbc0dTbtIzaJdBH14RKymt2lNIs-KuMhxJQ78_kxVof3GL5bs_sgAdv5qqD-rSWujx0YIXzzax6Q7lyTshRTY_mb7yZ7SF1TyEz0ay88CeWwpA=w2784-h1566-no)

and then I quickly went to see callme while he went up to the sky stage and I joined him after callme as we were both wanting to see Moso Calibration. For moso we were celebrating one of the girls birthdays, my then at the time oshi Iori (since switched to Mahiru) so during a solo during their last song we cracked our blue cyalume sticks that we were given to make the crowd blue as it’s her colour. From here we got some quick snaps of the scenery

and headed back down and finished our day, I headed back to the apartment and made sure I wasn’t going to sleep in again.

## Day 3
For day 3, I got up very early but it was nice to have tea eat my corn flakes and watch the olympics.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Moso style today <a href="https://t.co/YPwCoFKNSK">pic.twitter.com/YPwCoFKNSK</a></p>&mdash; tomo (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/761690378655313920">August 5, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I got to the ticket exchange as they opened at 8 and then queued for the Grand Market since I wanted to get in and make sure I’d have Moso Calibration handshake/checki tickets. The way it worked would be you’d walk quickly (not run) to the Tower Records stand and then fill out a form for your group to say how many CDs you want to pre-purchase. Generally 1CD = 1 ticket, so for Moso I decided to put a purchase in for 1CD+DVD & 1CD which was 2 tickets. You would then put down which store you want to pick these up, the thing is I wouldn’t be there to pick them up so effectively these count as bad sales and effect the oricon rankings for their release but as it is the only way for me to meet them I did it. After getting those I went to get a Niapin (Nia from Moso + Pinky from Dempa collab) shirt.

Following on from the grand market I went to Smile Garden to watch Maneki Kecak. Their song Joudan Ja Nai ne is really fun to see live:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OLdovsOgQ98?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I then heard that the Doll Stage where Niapin was pretty hard to get into so went straight there to make sure I was in early. So stood through @17 & palet which were good and got closer and closer to the front for Niapin. I was happy I could watch them as they had Pandaboy as their DJ so was a fun set. I then hung around for Muzubism and then hoped to make it to the sky stage for stereo japan but the line was really long as you had to get an elevator up there, so instead I went to the moso handshake/cheki early.

For their handshake/cheki it was 2tickets for handshake, compared to banmon’s 1 ticket for handshake. So I was only able to do 1 handshake with all the members. It was really fun as soon as they knew I was english they tried to get Mahiru to translate and ask them how to say things to me. It pretty much ended up with them holding my hands and saying how good they are today and asking if I’m ok. It was adorable. I stayed around for their complete session and then made my way over to try get back into the doll stage for PassCode but the line was long for that too, so I decided to just stand around in Smile Garden for Rocka Japonica. I stayed at the Smile Garden stage through Team Syachihoko and left after a song or two of Nijicon to get to the ship stage for Lyrical School & Kiyoshi Ryujin 25. Following on from that I just hanged around the Festival stage (near gundam) for Cupitron & Moso. After that I met up with Riku & French Anon  & his friends for drinking on the greens after the festival. That was really nice and chill and was the end of Day 3.

## Day 4
Today’s start was much like yesterday, I got my wristband and then stood in the grand market line. Today though I’d be getting tickets for banmon’s chekis/handshakes. I ended up with 6 tickets and with banmon’s chekis using 2 tickets & handshake 1 ticket, I decided to use it for 2 chekis with gumi & 2 handshake runthroughs. I met up with Riku again (who was getting his tickets) and after we’d done that we then bought some standard chekis (chekis without you) from the banmon stand. I got 3 chekis and swapped my miyuuchi with a gumi cheki riku had leaving me with a gumi, shiorin & misako which I was really happy with.

Following on from this we went to Smile Garden together to watch Moso Calibration and after their set we headed up to the Sky Stage for Maplez very early. I decided to watch it from the sky garden a bit further back since there was a lot of space there. After enjoying the groups from my spot I then headed down for food but as there was a queue to get down, it being very hot & not having eaten alot I felt really faint so I sat in the shade and then went to the toilet to change shirts. After that I went straight for my usual pizza place at Divercity. Following the lovely pizza and quick arcade session I met back up with Riku at the Grand Market for the banmon meeting session. I got in queue for Gumi quickly as we expected hers to be quite long but it was surprisingly quick. She recognised me from the cheki on Friday and tried to ask me some questions but I couldn’t answer very well before being politely moved away for the next person. However since I had 2 more rounds of chekis + redo, I was able to see her some more eventually telling her my name and I was from England. After the chekis the group moved to handshakes and so I was able to meet all of them again though Riku had moved further away from me so he could speak not about me. It was really really good.

After that we then went to the Ship Stage so we could try get prime positions for banmon’s set. So we were working our way up after each group before hand eventually thanks to a JP fan of another group swapping with us I was able to be front row and very conveniently on Gumi’s side of the stage. Their set was really really good and it was fantastic to be at the front and gumi side as I could cheer for her and she could really see me and point/acknowledge me. Continuing on, we then headed to the Hot Stage for Dempagumi.inc. I wanted to change my shirt so Riku went on ahead, unfortunately by the time I was changed I couldn’t get to him so I enjoyed Dempa by myself. I was on the right hand side a few rows from front which was nice. The crowd was a little rougher than I was expecting but it was still a great show.

Lastly I finally met up with Riku and we stayed around for the Grand Finale which was nice as it basically acted as a best of compilation of the festival. So I got to see the collaborations I missed like BabyraidsJapan & Wa Suta and of course more Mirin from Dempagumi.inc.

Heading back to the apartment I took a photo of my chekis from today

## Day 5

So for Day 5, I had a nice lay in before heading to Shibuya to go shopping with Riku & his friend. I left a bit earlier though to get food from a mcdonalds so for breakfast/lunch I had 2 hamburgers, 5 nuggets and a coke which was nice and nothing was forgotten which was a bonus. I also really enjoyed just sitting in there on social media and listening to the music thinking how awesome it is that you can be listening to Perfume and then the next song is JT. I think it may have been at that point that I realised I was actually in Japan rather than a music festival or something.

Anyhow after my meal I met up with Riku & his friend and we first went to Tower Records in Shibuya which is their flagship store but as they were doing stock takes only the first floor and floors for restaurants were open. Leaving that we went to HMV instead and there I picked up Perorin-sensei’s book, maneki’s latest single, wasuta’s album, moso’s latest single + one of their previous singles. I got those tax free using my passport and while it was nice to buy tax free it was a good 20mins of waiting while all the paperwork was filled out for it. Following on from that we headed to the Village Vanguard in Shibuya where I got some dempa tshirts, a present for my sister and banmon wristbands.

By now it was 3, so I said my goodbyes and made my way back to divercity to get merch for PassCode. With a brief stop at the apartment to drop things off, I arrived at DiverCity and got a tshirt, photo book, wristband & towel. I went then went back to my usual pizza place to wait for doors.

Headed down 10minutes or so before doors opened and met up with french anon as we had similar ticket numbers so basically went in together. After storing my backpack in a locker I headed into the venue and got a position by the first set of barriers, so essentially you had stage -> barriers -> 1st block -> barriers -> me at start of 2nd block and was on the left hand side of the stage. It was slow to fill up but got really busy just before showtime. I was a little nervous since I knew PassCode would be a rough concert and I usually prefer to be closer to the back so I thought if it got too rough I could make my way to the back or hold onto the barrier which is what I ended up doing. It was a very surreal concert experience for me being a blur of people doing crazy things like climbing onto the barriers and jumping forwards into the first block, standard moshpits, balloons and throwing cyalumes, it was quite a lot of fun even. Being a tour final we had a live band which was nice and the girls & crowd were giving it their all. We got 2 announcements, the first brought a lot of people around me to tears which was they got signed onto a major label and the second would be a new tour.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After the concert me and french anon left, I think he had work and I was at Disneysea so wanted early nights and didn’t stick around for cheki.

## Day 6

For DisneySea I woke up/left a little later than planned so by the time I got into the park it was already 20 past 8. I didn’t do too much research of where everything was so I mostly followed the crowds which took me into the line for Toy Story, bailing that I headed to fastpass Tower of Terror and got a time of 10:45 - 11:45. From here I then navigated to the lottery for Big Band Beat and the new show Out of Shadowland though I was unsuccessful in both lotteries. After missing out on those I then made my way to Journey to the Centre of the Earth and while the queue reckoned around 2 hours it was more like an hour half. It was not bad, but I was expecting a little bit more to be honest. After that I rode the electric railway back to the area with Tower of Terror and waited for my fastpass time.

Tower of Terror was fantastic, I really enjoyed the changes in theming compared to the Orlando version I was used to and while I feel it didn’t go as high it was still fun. After this I happened to walk past big band beat and saw people queuing so I asked a castmember if it was for the upper levels and since it was I got in line hoping I’d be able to get in. Getting there a good 45mins before it started guaranteed my spot and so I was able to see that and it was one of the highlights of the day. I do enjoy big band & swing music and the cast were superb with the songs, finale was the best.

Coming out of Big Band Beat I then went to grab food. I first tried the table service Italian close by but was turned away as I hadn’t made a reservation. The cast member pointed out on my map where to go for the Italian counter service and so I made my way over to that. The place was queuing to get in and it was getting to 1pm on the hottest august 9th on record in Tokyo so I was feeling pretty bad. Around 10 past 1, the whole queue got let inside and so I got 2 pizzas with a large coke which was delicious. I cooled off in there with people around me asleep on their seats for an hour or so, heading back out to catch the summer water festival.

The above was my position to watch the show, it was nice that the floats came out from right underneath me

I was recording them coming back through but there was a Japanese cast-member shouting something so I stopped just incase it was something to stop recording but a few seconds after I stopped the floats got rid of their excess water over the bridge and I got soaked. It was glorious!

After this I made my way into 20,000 leagues under the sea which was ok, not really too much to say about it to be honest. Following on from that, I walked around the park anti-clockwise, quickly popping into the Little Mermaid area to see if I could see the show but that was a nogo with no fastpasses and a 80min queue. Leaving there I made my way into the backend of the park (skipping aladdin’s area) for Indiana Jones & Raging Spirits. For these I used the single rider/fastpass queues and for Indiana Jones it was well worth it as I skipped the hour queue for something more like 10/15mins and I enjoyed it a lot. It was part test-track, part gringotts from universal orlando. Raging Spirits however was not worth the single rider, as the queue was an hour and I queued that in the single rider queue. I guess this was because most people come to the parks in 2s and so fit nicely into the raging spirits trains, which means we had to wait a long time to find 3s or 1s that had not known about single rider. For the ride itself it was really fun and was the first rollercoaster I’ve ridden where I’ve actually seen the loop, my previous looping experience was on aerosmith at wdw orlando which is in the dark.

I continued my loop of the park from there heading into port discovery for Aquatopia. That was a 30min queue and I was thinking throughout the queue, for a place called disneysea there aren’t too many water rides. Aquatopia really made up for it as I got drenched. This completed my loop and so I was back at the front of the park. I went into the main shop to get the 15th Anniversary tshirts me and the family wanted and then saw people were starting to sit down for Fantasmic. I thought it was too early for getting spots so I asked a castmember and they said it was fine to do so in this area though you had to stay within certain boundries. So 2 hours before Fantasmic my view looked like so:

It got a bit darker as fantasmic drew nearer:

The 2 hours flew by pretty quick and it was time for Fantasmic. Now I was expecting that everyone had been sitting down as no-one would stand for 2 hours and we’d stand up when the performance started, however the people around me remained seated so I stayed seated with them. I was a little disappointed with this as the boats & fencing in front of me obstructed the view from about half way downwards of the sorcerers hat. I will say however Fantasmic was fantastic! I absolutely love Fantasmic at Walt Disney World (2nd after Illuminations 2nd Act) and while I felt the Orlando version has the better story, I do really like the hat replacing the mountain and the dragon is so much better as it comes through the mirror. All in all a fantastic show!

I thought that was really special and was surprised by the lack of crowd around it. I do guess something like the below is a bit more captivating though:

Anyhow I headed back home to end my day/night at DisneySea and I loved it.

## Day 7

For Day 7 of the trip I didn’t have too many plans. I knew I wanted to do some more shopping, go through budget, book trains and possibly going Mogra. I had a nice layin since it was a lazy day and went through my budget for what I had spent and to work out how much I had left & averages left on each day. You can find my spreadsheet here incase it interests you: [Google Drive link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ae_LbPBB4z_vw0pIFyTgWwlnh53EI6TZ0qPjLMLIrVU/edit?usp=sharing). Anyhow with half my money spent I needed to start being a little more careful with what I buy.

So with that worked out I headed to Akiba. I mainly wanted to get a new King Blade to replace my smoked version 2 with a sparkling version 3 aswell as get a Chekki holder since I was starting to get a little collection and want to keep those safe.  
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got a 650ml can of pepsi by accident &amp; I still opened it as I was thirsty. Now i&#39;m stuck on the platform as I don&#39;t want to take it on train</p>&mdash; tomo (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/763242945810018304">August 10, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Once I eventually made it to Akiba my first stop was yodobashi for the chekki holder as Riku got his there and they are relatively cheap as they double up as business card holders. After a little bit of searching I found a holder and bought that. Leaving yodobashi I headed to Radio Kaigan for an explore. I knew they sold models in one of the stores there and I wanted to get a model toyota ae-86 for my work colleagues as a farewell present and in the Yellow Submarine I found exactly what I wanted. Continuing on in Radio Kaigan I found a shop called Trio which sold idol goods and ascended to heaven. I bought some more chekkis of gumi, an old mirin chekki, a mirin king blade top, gumi badge, mirin badge and mirin keyring. I left straight after that so as to not spend more money and made my way to Toranora to get tilt-six’s new album re:tilt-six and to a softmap to get the king blade & rock a japonica’s new single with amipon’s english b-side. I spent more time looking for the other Trio and leaving that soon after since it was primarily 48group related and also went looking for Mogra so I knew where to go. I also stopped at what was my favourite restaurant back on the 2014 trip and while nice wasn’t as good as the pizza in Odaiba. I came back after the shopping and took a quick picture of the haul

![Haul Pic](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wiJAbkSu5_d7vSh3amOvwviRdEd8AAgcGILzLQlXRhXQGSG9i50KlH7t3VuI5mIKA-tgEi_A3AN72zpgeFtpTmmpIWeR0DhnchUOW6x-qkG_ShAtjLcKfiBBGBb-xI7Cl3hyGXwDffoB6Y3Zx0WlcIhyWCsNBcwM-oPv36ZhuszDtpm2Yoe0LaYMPB9vZthGqc_obNKtiqKlDiNAzAzzSsHZNqcyvsyOAREU_h8Ee5nx5NRS4R0a_UGxlehBxsp-gpsOg2ad_lchVtJXWWkfbnLmlJsuTVoq6ifHTobcD0fGh1x-mDHrGiAJQjjRp8MQEBxsITNrnhK4LlWUpaFH3QYAtjAYw16Y8YL8ygOXtuFEJpYetFKwPg4-uDnEPIPLxovtq0idm1ZnPj1wO972cbrr5REUdNXrDDwhqKnr3OpnOepOBi5S9ZAGRa7mzLxJ_yPJTbXtg7XaoL-H3SFSCGi1HuQ7_I4YIEXUySLWn7ufbqadBxLLhpdr3wyHY2PEzla9mEIkLmnpylwXLT3ga4oIHs_fdN5MtmpmreqNy9O2hNKIHFAhD_a9-29MveRlFz_7XufWuyoimS2a3-yIfMZRXOoBhIyWdJ0VniTnmoo2dAeP=w896-h1592-no)

and passed the time til Mogra.

So when I came back to the apartment I checked the timetable for Mogra hoping Shiorin & Younapi would be on early enough that I could get the last train back to the apartment since I’d be traveling in the morning for 3 hours standing as that’s all I could get and with the amount of money spent shopping I was thinking I should save. I decided that if it was streaming online then I’d watch & fall asleep to that so waited until it was due to start and a good 30mins after. It wasn’t streaming so I headed off into the night to go Mogra.

Got to Mogra, was ID’d and paid my entry. I then stored my rucksack in the lockers and headed down into the club itself. I can’t really remember much as I used my free drink (& 2/3 500¥ coins) on Jaeger shots which were served in a test tube. I do though remember Shiorin & Younapi’s sets. Shiorin’s was very anisong and included my favourite anisong, a solo song and chaii max into banmon’s latest single which got everyone jumping, she even came away from the DJ booth into the crowd for everyone to kecha around her which was awesome to be a part of. For younapi it was more generic, we got more you’ll melt more songs and her solo songs compared to other peoples songs. I do think it was a little bit of a shame that most of the shiorin fans left after her set even though younapi was on straight after but oh well. Anyhow after younapi’s set I headed upstairs as Shiorin was doing 2shots & chekki pulls, I thought it was really cool how the banmon staff member recognised me from TIF and tried to speak to me about the night & how rare 2000¥ notes are (since hearing him say that cashiers constantly kept bringing it up). I bought 2 chekkis & 1 2shot but ended up getting a 2nd 2shot as they extended her slot for a few more minutes and the queue was very short. For my first chekki we just did standard peace signs but for my 2nd chekki I asked if we could [dab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_(dance)). She was a bit confused so I had to show her and she copied me. I’m really happy with the picture and that I taught Shiorin how to ‘dabbu’

![dabbu-ing with shiorin](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/urfihJavdrS_KrPScepvPNcM-_w2JdFHSaYTmV610PNtSKpyI67zc0xJ4c9uaPnGi7fdgnT-O2g76kSzovXmv-2_IwZJPTS4UGoc3zYqOycy3biTXOnmyWWae_kIns_ypP46X-6gdZDq-RKwkCf7TsuKLg74vnleRsvJzFtmPVSjCHzdgTkRX7s3CB0mwuVtkrHybJ2yuwM0wh_h6SaP63xWw2EoekPzfi015o_fY0FOty6XoVd2zakfpsBaqXhQFH33Ux9FZmKdqQyzrvgKNSQ7MrdPzPkiVl2OYZ9-NaG8KyKbiSWerqx8l0T9xQ0-JaU44nYpY-bXXWQtzj3UDF2q3CXUjpds3-yy-kQSNvFh9iHv-qOginhr6pte8jcqK65F4Hi9xQAMxcvh7vbFRWwu9nFfxq7t1_bp5EcvP5RqcZqGoLApJt1AYk3NAeasuBrgPk_IrhypsRXRZCLOIYkTH7U7P10kIDWDwCLv845Rkq2814RFMPbKV7QTxGtiLL9U_2CM9sx5ce0QOPUN94MM0Ud5g3LOBmEExUy0-z0rvWPufuC6GM4R1MMip-VL4KLCU-Gg7l1o6y2EkOjTHII7SXvtkNOYYOY-rN6wIBB35NCy=w163-h291-no)

In addition to that I think I confused the camera-woman (may have been mofuku-chan (owner/manager of dearstage/mogra ie. super important)) as she tried to speak to me in japanese. See I thought she asked how good is your japanese, but thinking back I think she asked how are you enjoying japan. So when I said it’s not great and doing a so-so hand gesture I think I shocked her.

After her slot younapi started not long after and for her I bought her solo single and 1 2shot which was also signed by her which was really nice! She asked for my name while she was signing it and I told her I really enjoyed her set which made her happy.

With that done, it was around 4:30am so the trains were running again so I left to get the train back to apartment and maybe some sleep.

I saw Manatsu from BabyraidsJapan post a picture of a drink a day or two before hand so I bought it thinking it was water but it was some weird fruit/ion thing and was disgusting. That and coupled with me standing up and not having ate anything major made my journey pretty unpleasant for at least the first hour of the trip up north to Aoimori. Once we reached Sendai some people did leave so I was able to sit down on my bag and I think I fell asleep there as next thing I knew we were past Morioka and it was only an hour left to Aomori. However due to all the tunnels my wifi wasn’t working too well so doing anything required alot of persistence.

When we arrived at Shin-Aomori I followed the crowd thinking everyone was going to Aoimori itself.

I noticed something was wrong as we were moving to countryside rather than a city so I got off at the next station and ended up  at the station above in a place called [Tsurugasaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsurugasaka_Station). The next train back to Aomori was in an hour and it would take a while and it wasn’t too safe to walk along the road back so I waited in the little station building

The hour long wait caused me to go a little mad as seen below but it was a beautiful place thinking back.

Eventually I got on a train back to Aomori and after a bit of a walk arrived at the hotel. I checked in dropped off my bags and then left for the Dempa concert. I navigated to the venue but there wasn’t anyone around. Wondering where everyone was, I checked the times on the ticket and to my shock I was 15mins late for the show. I found an entrance for the venue and was shown to my seat. I was on the left hand side and just in front of sound/light team area. Thankfully I had only missed ゴスペラーズ which I wasn’t too fussed about. They were nice enough to listen to but I didn’t really know them.
  
After a quick changeover, the dendenband took to the stage and launched into the intro and then the dempa girls took to the stage for Ba! To The Future! It was a fun show and they did a lot of my favourite songs. However I was a little disappointed after the show as both groups were only on for 1 hour and there was no encore, if I had known that before hand I would have probably not gone to see the shows or maybe just the kishidan show (more on that tomorrow!). Anyway after the concert I got my merch: tour shirt, pocket shirt & badge and also participated in the Mirin Birthday Message. For my birthday message, I of course said Happy Birthday and let her know that this time I came to Japan to see her which I hope makes her happy.

After that I headed back to hotel room and crashed to bed.

## Day 9

![My View from Hotel](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6jS4EDDT4kCSM3pAg39t5-4GISZxg4Jp5AgfBN0gVpxPKxpOjWaJ4ddl7SXVuWO6JMxhTWGhCAAS3yQw1rpSQ8ORWSNIMWPUx_mTwfpDktCY0Rr9I_kd04l5V2B8oVIZlzeGi51x-b7Hpf7jF9lJzOI_SB5rc3PnWgZSzrNQQHQ6O6gv48a931iCzVrSt5GpMXMoz4fq4rxprnwnF9UT_y1iheibZyQWiYEOqvpqoXDEa0PCk1m0IeF-nK6eLeBZhcH_sf1cH-kXupvLjpQGzdfLlvIDuHo52vGhlgddjvtBeEfjMUZlnSa4PW_g04Dn-bqiOQb18LC4BhMQLPxlj5A4jJxi6DqR1w2jyBHsYVIVbK5IAVmK6wgTB4GY_HaX1Te-MVQamJ-l7jKFc5zNtNZKzlCza81KRSByU9BUVOARHznJs7FcduLwNqwomHRQk9CcRYPNAvehqLgC9aDG5pIWT-ZviuAnuoJFeidI67wJLU8x3nH4nEgU8T3ArAPDw2_zdITz0y5I_rR4f2_kUjM8Mn-FSvqEf_ouglsUJ0Jt6UWvW7wu9stA8R0zCaSQhqvGQzOY-8PkMRWRh2_rLhxxKZ2dd-ytFJz-QOuguB8-_KTY=w882-h1566-no)

It was a beautiful morning in Aomori but I had a dilema. I needed to head to the station so I could get reserved seats for the upcoming trips on the bullet train to morioka and back today, and then to Tokyo tomorrow as the later I left it meant potentially not getting a seat. However due to my eating habits I was finding it hard to find places to eat so wanted to not leave too early so I could stay at the hotel until it’s pizza place opened.

I decided that getting the reserved seats was more important to me, so I set off to get those reserved. Thankfully I was able to get on all the trains I wanted pretty quickly but that left me with quite a while until I needed to leave aomori so I went to sit in the nearby starbucks as I could at least get hot chocolate/tea. A few hours of drinking tea & hot chocolate and getting free samples of food+drink I didn’t like, I set off on a train to shin-aomori and then onto Hayabusa 22 to Morioka for Dempa + Kishidan.

![Morioka Station](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WPxB-9bMdhFD-bVnyrE3PvqQqzFzLrp1FXpQpwtxzWHX1taHuXaB2w1q09j8RBgSzY3qv1hB7gHoXXtr7COnkHsgkgifL48pHKLhP4nNn6ZMfqJ7DRMHJRcON0Knh_xuKsYKvSmmyYTkNc0Fq9h3wlJAvPif3pPcd35J9A9OnyL2hFGrwWKEJc1YLCh29qeT2r1s98Dko_udCgHlNkHP-gWQFhMMILITQugI_REvDdph_CCmqNti7vfHPVA9fowdXY9TIKJ-qa9jOPKLtZavBrlfUGr0yslgRgpmn9_-A7m7zz-L0H225NgEUuWaAmfgoj2p9PTro24-7r1cOVRkWlB6KcZjXSmME21TZBERvMsYCopYZLfvm8DK4n0GKmH1-Mm4vt2MuCpc3vCuz99Hyhxb7JT6mPp6Lxbq8cuweniVID4dNgClU-8Sl7SrbyVZ1qehQTxd8yjYejfpF1bzHEP3lcJVQNlcEHpu1NhfpNB6Hpf_EfvHfAyFQEgimyFCortq2fvGWLJDzf9hqu5JLqEtVMFAfAKbMl50oAwn0zJxnRaJSddk1fC8FEd5998VZgklVxsPojg3Klt7Udk75vPnr2X-y6Hov825Ye3VQHnhJXvN=w2788-h1568-no)

I arrived at morioka a few hours before the concert as I was not going to be late for Kishidan. Inside the station is a mall and thankfully there was a mcdonalds inside so I could get some food which was delicious. After this I mostly hanged around the entrance area of the venue as I was meeting up with Keitaro who was one of the dempa wotas who came to London when Dempa were there last year. We quickly spoke to each other and met the people he was there with and then went to our seats. I was near the back again and Keitaro was a lot further forwards so I said my goodbyes here and waited for the show to start with Kishidan.

Now Kishidan was a lot of fun, they put on a good show and I loved the EDM rearranges of their songs for their 2nd group. After them it wasn’t long before Dempagumi took to the stage and put on another good performance though it was very similar to last night. Thinking back to it, I enjoyed Kishidan a lot more than Dempa.

Anyhow, I left as soon as they finished (knowing there wasn’t going to be an encore) so I could get the bullet train back up to Aomori for my hotel which was a little bit of a shame as I would of liked to of hanged with Keitaro and his friends a bit more. But anyhow I made it back to the hotel which was a delight as didn’t want to end up in Tsurugasaka again late at night. I readied a lot of alarms to make sure I was awake to get the first shinkansen to Tokyo in the morning and watched the Shelter audio video that went up and went to sleep.

## Day 10

I woke up to my alarms and left on the journey back to Tokyo. Everything was going great I was making all the trains I needed to and got on the shinkansen all good. However the train got held at Ichinoseki for a while and was unsure of the cause, it turned out to be an electrical outage between morioka and sendai. I arrived in Tokyo at 11  a lot later than expected. From here I went to the Yurikamome station to wait for Peter who was coming from Comiket as I thought I wouldn’t have time to change before hand. Though as we in no rush to get to Momoclo, we ended up going back to my apartment so I could change and drop off my stuff. We ended up also going back to Peter’s apartment in Akihabara so he could drop off his goods from Comiket.

From Akihabara we made our way to Nissan Stadium in Yokohama, it took a little while but it was nice to have Peter there to pass the time. Once we got there I went straight for Merchandise, getting programmes for me and a friend back home, the exclusive BD, penlight, shirt, towel and book. Unfortunately I couldn’t get the fan as they had all sold out. From the merch we walked around the stadium a bit taking in all the stalls and looking for the international fan meetup which we ended up not finding.

We went into the stadium quite a bit early and we were very high up which was a little suprising as I thought I had arena tickets but nevertheless there was the Reni & Momoka solo shows on the screens so we could watch them and Peter had some conversations with the fans around us. I also showed Peter the magic of Gatsby Face & Body wipes (essential in Japan)

It seemed to go past relatively quickly and wasn’t long before Momoclo started. Having seen the previous Tohjinsais and kinda seeing a show at Kishidan Expo in 2014 I knew what was happening but it was great seeing Peter experience all of this for the first time. It was very theatrical and there was always something happening even when the girls weren’t on stage. There were some issues with sound in the stadium which kinda lessened my experience and being all the way up on the highest levels meant not a lot of room to wotagei but it was still a lot of fun!

After the concert we walked to Yokohama station where we talked more about Idols and found I couldn’t use my JR East pass because it only covered the other part of Japan (East of Tokyo) so we ended up getting a train back to where we got off in the afternoon and back to Tokyo that way. From here we said our goodbyes and I went back to my apartment to pack as I would be leaving soon and get ready for more momoclo tomorrow.

## Day 11

I started off today heading to Tokyo Tower as I had not been and wanted to get a friend at Tokyo Tower ornament for his desk. I ended up getting him a nanoblock figure of it (which I have found in this country so kinda defeats the point of getting one in japan) and got myself an ornament too since I’d be starting a new job soon and wanted something for my desk.

From Tokyo Tower, I headed back to Trio in Akihabara to get some more Idol Chekis, this time getting 2 Mirin & a Gumi Cheki. I also got a Kanako kingblade holder and Kanako Snapback. After a successful Trio trip and eating at the usual Akihabara pizza place, I made my way to the stadium for Day 2 of Momoclo.

I once again took a look at the merch but wasn’t too much as got most of it yesterday and generally around the venue. As I had 2 tickets today but was only myself the staff took my other ticket. This is to stop ticket touts so I couldn’t sell my ticket on so I can understand why they’d do it but was it was difficult to explain it’s just me today. Anyhow inside the stadium I had much better seats and sat next to some Kanako oshis which was nice. We talked about the group and they gave me some sweets and plastic bags to put my bag into as we would be within the splash zone.

Day 2 of the Concert was definitely a better gig and possibly my favourite gig of the tour. We were so close to everything and getting wet in the splash zone on hot summer days is great. I quickly snapped some photos when the concert finished of my seating for this one:

I said thank you to the people around me for the generosity and made my way back to the original station and back home to the apartment that way. When home, I checked my luggage again and made sure everything was tidy and then headed to bed.

## Day 12

There isn’t really much to say for this last day, I got the monorail to Haneda Airport which was nice and got on the plane to leave. My luggage came in just under the 23kg and picked up some Toyko Bananas and Kitkats. It was nice to have a direct flight and was easy to get back through home customs. It was sad leaving a place where I’d had such fun on this trip. I’ll leave you with some photos of the merch I got:

## Final Thoughts (October Edition)

So another trip done, I’ve been working on this blog post since the 27th August and we’re now coming up to November. I’ve already been looking at potential next trips around New Year for Momokuri at Christmas + Dempagumi Arena Shows in early January. But those are unlikely with imports and paying off the credit card. I’m hoping to get back very soon.

I think this trip has made me even more into idols and specifically meeting them. I’ve become so much of a bigger banmon fan by meeting the girls, especially Gumi, but also the banmon staff guy who recognised me at Mogra and tried to talk to me. Just being a part of that scene even for a few days has me yearning to go back and stay a part of that scene for a long time meeting the idols and supporting them with all my effort.

I’m looking forward now to my next trip which’ll be in New York in November to see Momoclo. I hope us overseas mononofu & jp mononofu can put on a real show for the girls and the casual fans.

Anyway that’s this blogpost done, you can find all the pictures and some extras here: [https://goo.gl/photos/ioyuzjtMcCCGnTTr7](https://goo.gl/photos/ioyuzjtMcCCGnTTr7). It’s been a long-en so thanks for sticking with it to the end! If you have any questions / comments get in touch with me [@tomouchuu](https://twitter.com/tomouchuu). I’d love to talk about anything!

## Final Final Thoughts (February Edition)
So I’ve finished this blogpost. It’s been a bit of a slough to write at times but I’m glad I’ve done it. Since the October Update, I’ve been on my 3rd Trip to Japan (Blogpost Eventually!) and been on that trip to New York to see Momoclo which will be next for the blog post treatment. I hope you’ve all enjoyed this and I can look back with fond memories in the future on this trip.
