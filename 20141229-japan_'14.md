title: Japan '14
date: 29th December 2014
---

So yeah, that happened. I decided to put my name into the raffle for this years Magical Mirai concert in Tokyo. It was scheduled for 20th September and I thought "Hey, if I did win tickets then I can go for my Birthday since that is on the 14th". And my name got drawn. Somehow I had saved some money but that was no where near enough to pay for the trip and survive over there however my lovely grandmother was generous enough to give me some money as my birthday present. Since I had never organised a holiday by myself and most travel agents didn't really do trips to Japan, I went online and got in touch with Inside Japan Tours. They were so helpful and were able to get exactly what I wanted.

The week I had booked just so happened to be the perfect week to go as a music fan as it turns out everyone tours that week. EGOIST had their Nagoya date on the 15th, Babymetal were playing in Chiba on the 13th and 14th, PERFUME were playing all that week in Yoyogi, SCANDAL were also playing a fair amount at the Akasaka Blitz, Sawano Hiroyuki were playing on the Friday, some Vocaloid-Ps were at 2.5d for the Rana vocaloid launch etc. I am so so thankful for the staff at the tour company who were able to secure tickets to the Kishidan Banpaku, EGOIST and SCANDAL. So with all of it paid off, I was ready to go!

### Day 1
![image](http://i.imgur.com/OwK7mQ3.jpg)
A foggy morning at London Heathrow. It was a teary goodbye with my parents who drove me there and helped me check in. I had booked a spot into one of traveller lounges which was a nice place of calmness, even if I did spend a fiver on rubbish beans on toast.

### Day 2
So after spending eleven hours in the air I arrived tired and feeling a tad sick on Japanese land. I seriously can not fault the cabin crew, they let me continue to sit on the plane and even gave me a big bottle of water to take with me while I recovered from the flight.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/EDjKJmU.jpg)

Being the last one off the plane has some nice benefits, the whole airport was empty, it was a surreal experience and it doesn't quite hit you that you've arrived. That is until you see:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/CdMBdih.jpg)

Past all the customs and collecting my luggage I am greeted by two lovely women from the tour operator. I was definately being hella awkward and I don't think it had still sunk in since I was following them in awe of everything. I was taken to the place to get my rail pass and they also bought me a green ticket (First Class) on the Narita Express. I waved my goodbyes to them and off I went on a nice train journey. It was amazing how green everything was and how dense the vegetation was, flying past on the train gives a nice glimpse of rural Japan.

Now when those women said take to a taxi from Chiba Station to the hotel, listen to them and do it. I decided instead to go there on foot. I got lost. It took me over an hour and it was very hot, especially when you're wearing a jumper and a hoodie in the middle of the day. Eventually I managed to find my way to the hotel and probably made a lot of Japanese people confused wondering why a foreign guy with a big red suitcase is wandering around their neighbourhood. The hotel was really nicely situated in a square with a FamilyMart across the street. Since I was still too early to check in I confusingly managed to ask if I could leave my suitcase with them and go for a wander round.

First stop was the FamilyMart and I bought some more water, poccari sweat (which I had heard a lot about) and some bread. After successfully buying that and leaving the shop I sat in the square and preceded to try the bread and drink. Poccari sweat, nice! The bread not so much... I tossed it in my backpack and went on an adventure. I decided to go by the landmarks and the main one near me was the monorail line. As long as I knew where that was, I could make it back. So I wandered and wandered, eventually finding a nice park.

I think it was around 1pm now, I couldn't check in till 3pm so I decided why not go to Akihabara? And so I set off! I did want to ride the monorail too, so using the change from the FamilyMart shop I was on the monorail back to Chiba station. I spent a while bumbling around there working out which platforms to go on and adding money to my Manaca card. Eventually I was on the slow car to Akihabara. The journey was really nice, crossing the many rivers and with the areas getting denser and denser. A while later I stepped off the train and into Akihabara. First on my list of things to do was Gamers. Walking in and seeing all the merchandise that you have always wished you could buy is a great feeling, but alas it is hard to resist. I ended up buying a limited edition of Vocalospace, the Aldnoah.Zero ED single, Lantis 15th anniversary album, livetunes 'to' album which I had been listening to a bunch on the plane and while walking around and Hanazawa Kana's latest BD. It was a surprise to then be given posters and clear files for buying those things. I had completely forgotten about store bonuses. After buying all of that and going into Club Sega I had gone way over my daily allocation so I headed back to the hotel. However some 'lovely' Japanese women decided I wanted some artwork and postcards, and me being a complete sap bought it. It made a nice gift for my Grandmother so that I wasn't complaining. By now I could check in and the journey back to Chiba coincided with schools finishing so the trains were a bit packed but was still nice to be heading back.

However, I made a grave mistake. I would walk back to the hotel from Chiba. I followed the wrong monorail and got lost again. This time though I was carrying a fair amount and I needed the toilet. While I was able to hear the going home song, it wasn't the most fun of times. I did eventually make it back to the hotel. The room I got was very nice and had good views from my windows.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/7ExSxiZ.jpg)

So I unpacked what I needed for tomorrow and of course took a picture of what I had bought today: ![image](http://i.imgur.com/5YbCgZG.jpg) I went to bed, watching some baseball, the Japanese dub of the Powerpuff Girls and the 2.5d Rana stream. I ended up waking up sometime around 1/2am and went on Teamspeak much to the amusement of my friends as they got to ask me silly questions while I was half-asleep. It was great to talk to them and helped with some home-sickness.

### Day 3
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>So WiFi all set up and waiting for the train to the festival. Left a little late</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/510572933278744576">September 12, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was off on my adventure to the Kishidan Banpaku. It’s a music festival around twenty minutes away by train and then a further twenty minutes by bus from Chiba Station. I left late but got there pretty early which was nice enough. It was something like 28&deg;C or something like that with not a cloud in the sky so silly old me decided to a) Not bring a hat and b) Not wear any sunscreen lotion. It was very very hot and all I had was my hoodie (Which it was far too hot for) and sunglasses. You can see me looking all nice here:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/r5LyshH.jpg)

It was however right by the ‘sea.’ I say sea because it’s really a big bay and if you look hard enough you can see Tokyo opposite. It was nice and breezy by the seafront so I stayed there while the concert was beginning to start.

So typically for Kishidan I was stood around this far from the stage:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/yT3vDHr.jpg)

It was nice since I had my own space, could still hear the artists well and was able to see what the crowd was like. (Don't play the audio for the following when volume is loud)

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OaMqTrwJPmK/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I moved a tad closer when Kyary Pamyu Pamyu were due on since she was really the only artist I really knew:

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OaOVDLEpj2q/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Kyary was a blast! Maybe it was because I was in Japan or maybe because none of these people would ever see me again but I was able to join in with all the jumping and fan movements. Something I find embarrassing to do over here. After Kyary I retreated back and walked around the festival grounds some more. I bought a beer and my first proper meal PIZZA! The other option was a:

Right about now evening was beginning to start with the sun setting. The heat was still over powering but it was absolutely beautiful:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/Dv6VRza.jpg)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Anyway all the glowsticks are coming out, it&#39;s gonna get very very awesome here</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/510730088883560449">September 13, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And boy did it! Momoiro Clover Z put on a super performance. (Ignore that my phone autocorrected momo to mono)

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OaieIwh3XgH/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

![image](http://i.imgur.com/WCw6VWp.jpg)

However make sure you learn from my mistake:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>If you ever do go to a MomocloZ concert make sure to a) Have glowsticks for every/favourite member b) Know every dance/audience part</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/510792681551699968">September 13, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It really does make a difference if you can join in with certain songs and show your support for a certain member of the group. It’s one thing I noticed especially with the Momoclo fans there who wore their favourite member’s colour. They covered themselves and really went all out! There were also some fireworks to finish the night which was a tad emotional too!

![image](http://i.imgur.com/Ys8WDLe.jpg)

After that it was time to head back to the hotel, it was a weird experience since the way back is to take the shuttle bus and then train and that's what pretty much everyone did. It was busy but never scary. Eventually I made it back to the hotel and put on some form of anti-itching gel and showered.

### Day 4
Today I left the hotel in Chiba to stay in a hotel in Shiodome, I once again got lost in Shiodome trying to find the hotel but was amazed when I did. This place was amazing:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/m3wKlcB.jpg)

It was right on the subway line so made it really easy to find when I did eventually find it. I was able to once again confusingly drop my bags off and then head back out. And what a surprise I'm back in Akihabara. This time I went to K-Books to pick up some gifts for friends - but I ended up with all of this!

![image](http://i.imgur.com/Ci9YjEW.jpg)
![image](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9Ssrb.jpg)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Anyway currently in KFC in Akiba. Ordered a bunch of Chicken Nuggets and Drumsticks. I don&#39;t like drumsticks...</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/511027338885079040">September 14, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While on the subject of food I did manage to find stuff to eat in Japan. I’m a very fussy eater so I was pretty much stuck to fast food options. I did, however, have trouble conveying what I wanted since I couldn't speak the language. Most restaurants have the menu on the till desk so you can see and point for situations like these but it didn’t seem to help me a lot of the time. Eventually I worked out how to order at McDonalds and that’s where I ate all the time. It just about kept me alive along with all the snacks I brought from home.

Anyway I headed back to my hotel and changed to go out to the Robot Restaurant. It was also my birthday so I guess I treated it as a party for me. After eventually making my way there (Once again getting lost) I found the restaurant. It was a tad scary for me to go there alone as it is in Kabukicho so that was nervy but I just kept my head down and walked as quick as possible, however it is literally impossible to miss, just look for the multitude of lights that will blind you.

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/Oaw7BJrZEKe/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We&#39;re now listening to Words can&#39;t bring me down with violin and piano. Of course they&#39;re dressed as robots.</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/511097868157874177">September 14, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It is a really surreal experience at the Robot Restaurant, there are girls in skimpy clothing and robots and lights and loud music. It's all a bit over the top and an expensive tourist trap. Still though it was a good thing to at least do.

### Day 5
Leaving Shiodome was sad as it was such a nice area, example being just outside my hotel:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/7m4vfxf.jpg)

I didn't know what it was until a few days later when I learned it was something to with Ghibli. Anyway today I was due to head to Nagoya for the EGOIST concert so I took the Bullet Train.

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OatDLZI5jF6/embed/simple" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OatQBi3jvni/embed/simple" width="370" height="370" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I arrived in Nagoya at 1:10pm and check in wasn't until 2pm so I went and looked for the venue and there was already a line forming. Using my knowledge of British gigs I assumed this was the queue to get in, so I went back to the McDonalds I had found and had some hamburgers. I eventually joined the line at 2:30pm after hearing you could buy merch at 3pm which clicked as to why there was a queue.
It turns out in Japan that you queue for merch before the show and then you get let into the venue based on the number on your ticket. While I much prefer this system it’s hard when you can’t read your ticket and don’t know what area you’re supposed to be in.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>EGOIST名古屋&#10;結構並んでますねー！ <a href="http://t.co/d3RSfYsedZ">pic.twitter.com/d3RSfYsedZ</a></p>&mdash; kazu*fam (@kazu_nagi) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazu_nagi/status/511384651919683584">September 15, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Anyway that's a picture of the line as I joined. Right about now though my skin which was recked from the sunburn from Kishidan was still peeling which is pretty embarrassing when everyone is looking at you since I'm probably the only foreigner at this gig. Anyhow just under two hours later I was able to get merch and bought a T-Shirt and the album. I did want a towel but they had already sold out of the design I wanted and silly me didn't think to just get the other design. The Zepp Nagoya is a super nice venue though:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/C3vMceG.jpg)

So with 45minutes til doors open and everyone seemingly just standing around (They were actually in their spots for entry) I found an arcade next to it and played some Sound Voltex 2 and Project Diva Arcade to waste some time.

Eventually the numbers in my area were called (1382 was my number) and I was let in.

That concert has since become the best gig ever. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it. I brought a glowstick the day before as I knew EGOIST were a glowstick group so I was really happy to be able to use that and then they played pretty much everything. Including B-Sides and album tracks, admittedly they only have the one album and a few singles but it was great to hear tracks that may never be played again. Plus the fact this was their first tour and that this was the last night of the tour made for a really special night. The people who had been to the other concerts on the tour were good at dictating crowd movements as well as Chelly herself who I’d heard had become much more confident in herself over the tour. We ended up getting to hear the new Psycho Pass ED 'Fallen' first which was absolutely killer live and she returned for a 2nd encore to do a cover of Supercell's 'Melt' which was incredible for me as a big Vocaloid fan. It's a song that means a lot to the vocaloid community and doesn't get played at the Magical Mirai concerts so here I thought I would never hear it live and join in with the 'la's. During the credit roll, when the name 'ryo(supercell)' appeared everyone gave a big cheer, it’s amazing what that one guy has done for Vocaloid and now Anime music in general. I stood in the venue for ten or so minutes after it was over, processing what I had been a part of. I don't know what the message says but it's something I will always remember:

### Day 6
Day 6 was a lazy day, I spent most of the morning watching TV in the morning and when checkout time came I then moved to the arcades from yesterday. I was going to visit the Makoto Shinkai exhibit in Mishima on the way back but since yesterday was a public holiday it was shut today. Anyway I was on the train back to Tokyo and Ikebukuro when I got a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu">@tomopagu</a> are you safe? I heard there was a big earthquake in Tokyo just now..</p>&mdash; A;Shidqi (@AlfisarShidqi) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlfisarShidqi/status/511769926990700544">September 16, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As it turns out there was an earthquake and I did see some messages about minor inconveniences on the yamamote line (Equivalent to the London Underground's Circle Line), yet I didn't feel a thing. Not sure whether it happened when I was in Nagoya or on the Bullet Train. Anyhow I checked in fine at my last hotel and my luggage had arrived so I took that upstairs and got settled in before heading out again to look round the shops.

I got lost again looking for either of the two Toranoanas in Ikebukuro but eventually found one and bought a lot. I also visited Animate and Tower Records.
My luck of buying food I don't like continues:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Today has not been a good day for ordering food. Ordered what I thought were chicken nuggets from KFC. Ended up with 6 chicken wings...</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/511801063716839424">September 16, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As a quick tally, I arrived with 177,000¥. By the end of today I was left with 60,000¥. So I have spent 117,000¥ (£624~) in five days. Anyway this is what todays loot looks like:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/Suposty.jpg?1)

### Day 7
For Day 7 I was joined by a guide called Michiyo who was lovely and showed me around some places I hadn't thought about going. I woke up late (again) so it was a hard morning of walking around but was nice to do. To start with we visited Sensō-ji which is a Buddhist temple located in Asakusa. It has the most amazing gate which my guide took a picture of me with:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/4w2w98P.jpg)
![image](http://i.imgur.com/TLkLaDA.jpg)
![image](http://i.imgur.com/jOhNh9o.jpg)

She showed me how to purify and then make the prayer which was cool, though I was worried about messing it up and I think I might of, because then I had my fortune told and got:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/M4XvNov.jpg)

She did say this temple has a higher percentage of bad fortunes to good fortunes but oh well. I tied it up like you're supposed to for bad fortunes so as to leave the bad luck behind.
We then visited the Skytree that while expensive is a must do for views like:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/eUI2Mr0.jpg)

After having a stop to have a coffee at the Skytree cafe we made our way down and went to Akihabara. Here she showed me the most amazing pizza shop. For 1000¥ you get a large margarita pizza, unlimited water and a coffee. It was so nice and probably the first proper meal I've had while in Japan aside from Fast Food restaurants and stalls. We went electronics shopping and she showed me where to find Mogra (which I did't unfortunately visit on a club night) before we continued onto Tokyo Station:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/hkniCVc.jpg)

After that we took a short walk to the Imperial Palace and got my picture taken at the 2 bridges:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/4suYatA.jpg)

Learning about the imperial family and how the political system works was also nice since it's not something I generally think about. From here we took another walk discussing music a long the way which was nice. It was definitely nice to have someone you can just talk to about what life is like there compared to home and stuff like that. Eventually we got to the subway line we needed to go on to get to Odaiba and were lucky enough to get the front seat of the train:

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OWKl9QFOH5K/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In odaiba we visited the Gundam statue and the mini statue of liberty:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/fMPSf3G.jpg)
![image](http://i.imgur.com/1drVR1g.jpg)

With a nice view looking back at Tokyo towards Tokyo Tower and the Rainbow Bridge:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/ZxTHHhX.jpg)

After this we had just enough time for Shibuya Crossing before I had to be at the SCANDAL concert, so she escorted me on my way there and we said our goodbyes.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/1OYEjeS.jpg)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>T-shirt, towel and pick aquired! Last minute hamburger and toilet before the show now.</p>&mdash; tomo(パグ) (@tomopagu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomopagu/status/512159406822137856">September 17, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So with that acquired, queuing to get in was nice enough since I had some grasp of the ticketing system.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/WE9tJkJ.jpg)

SCANDAL was a good show. We got to hear a lot of new songs of the new album which was nice and the crowd were excited for the older songs. Gonna try my hardest to replicate that for the English fans when they come over here in April.
Anyway loot for today looked like so:

![image](http://i.imgur.com/ayU4AsB.jpg)

I finally bought a hat.

### Day 8
For Day 8, I found myself waking up late again which was really bad for today I was at The Ghibli Museum. I had heard that you need to be there for when your ticket says or you won’t be allowed entry. So I ran from my hotel to Ikebukuro and then I ran from the station closest to the museum to it. I was so exhausted and hungry, but alas I had made it.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/BkAwhST.jpg)
![image](http://i.imgur.com/8ZjrP55.jpg)

It was a nice experience to do and I loved the cinema but I’m not the biggest Ghibli fan so I didn’t appreciate it as much as I should have. I was done by mid day and so I spent a few hours in Nakano Broadway.

I'd heard it's a must-do but I was thoroughly let down. Not sure why I didn't enjoy it as much as other people did. There was a nice Idol store and Mandarakes were ok but I don't know. Unless you like old stuff I don't see why you'd go there over Akihabara. So left there, picked up another CD in Toranoana for a friend and played more Sound Voltex at an arcade close to the hotel.

### Day 9
So as today was my last day with the Rail Pass, I decided to visit the Makoto Shinkai exhibit in Mishima. So another trip on the bullet train! When there it was a tad awkward to find as it was so quiet.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/wLUgiFh.jpg)

When I did eventually find it I was greeted by 3 members of staff so I bought my ticket to enter. When inside downstairs acted as a cinema and a store. The cinema showed interviews from all his films, when I entered they were showing The Garden of Words extras so I watched that for a bit before heading upstairs to the main exhibit. The main exhibit was mostly original storyboards and art of his films and work. To be honest it was a little lacklustre but made a nice peaceful change. With that seen and some merchandise bought, I headed back into Tokyo.

When back in Tokyo I headed to Akihabara for food at the Pizza place and then went to Toranoana there and was able to pick up some more CDs I wanted. After that I went to Yoyogi National Gymnasium which is where PERFUME were playing.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/83uhcnm.jpg)

There was no concert today which is why it looks empty. I was unable to get a ticket to see them which was a shame but I noticed here that the merch desks were outside so I formed a plan. Anyway after this I continued onto Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium which is where Magical Mirai is going to be.

<iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/OWjpF1pMBzI/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

![image](http://i.imgur.com/nCFpbgQ.jpg?1)

So this was them setting up the day before, so I got an early look at prices and the area around the venue. I didn't stay too long since I was worried they might be annoyed with me. After that I headed back to the hotel.

### Day 10
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>初音ミクさん、楽屋入りです！！ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B8%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4?src=hash">#マジカルミライ</a> <a href="http://t.co/qG83hm5sac">pic.twitter.com/qG83hm5sac</a></p>&mdash; 初音ミク マジカルミライ 公式 (@magicalmirai) <a href="https://twitter.com/magicalmirai/status/513107867935571968">September 19, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Today was Miku Day and after deliberating for a while about what merch to buy at both Magical Mirai and PERFUME and which order to do them in I settled on Magical Mirai first.

![image](http://i.imgur.com/9N9V2M3.jpg)

Ticket pickup was at 10am, so I made sure to be there before hand so I could be one of the first to get my ticket and get into the already hour long queue. With the ticket picked up with most kerfuffle possible I joined the back of the queue, glued to twitter to keep an eye on merch stock. While the shirt I wanted had sold out of Smalls and Mediums I had reached the desk in time for to pick up a large. I wasn't even bothered if it didn't fit me, I had to get a shirt. Thankfully it did anyway so with that, tokyo towel, glowstick and programme bought, I made my way to Yoyogi for PERFUME merch. See it occurred to me that sometimes they don't check for a ticket when you buy merch, so I thought I'd give it a go and see if I can get some merch. Lo and behold I could so I bought a towel, programme and wristbands. I then went to a McDonalds in Harajuku, made the staff member serving me laugh with my accent and had a nice time eating that. From there I went back to the hotel and changed into super Miku fan:

Heading back to Magical Mirai was exciting and then we went in. Presented with a goody bag of adverts I made my way to my designated seat.

HOLY FUCK! I'm really close and I'm on Drummer side which is awesome since I can watch him clearly when not watching Miku herself. It was nice getting there early-ish since I was able to have a chat with some fellow fans around me. Turns out there were a few of us Brits there so we had a chat and were joined by an awesome australian too. However my time was cut short by a guy whose seat was right in between me and them and preceded to have the most miserable face and was glued to his phone. Things got worse when tall hairy metal heads sat in the row in front. The guy who was on my right turned up just before it started, he was fairly upset when he asked about where I got the glowstick to tell him they had sold out. I guess he took doors as in, that's the time to go there pick up your ticket and buy merch before heading in and by the sounds of it, most of the merch was sold out. I felt sorry for the guy so as the lights were getting dimmed I gave him one of my glowsticks and told him how it worked. It was then Miku appeared and the concert started.

It was a nice experience and even emotional. When you dream of that moment when you're finally at a concert that you have dreamed of going too, and then you're there surrounded by a sea of green. It is a really special moment.

Me and the guy did our glowstick waving throughout all the songs, the hairy metalheads with their rubbish glowsticks looked behind in awe at the awesomeness. One had given up completely, another had resorted to using his glowsticks as drumsticks (Note: Don't do this) the other guy next to me continued wanting to kill himself as he sat on his phone. And 2 hours, arms in pain the concert was over and we said our last goodbyes to Miku and the gang.

I did say in a tweet it was the best concert so far, and it was special, though looking back. I enjoyed EGOIST far more. While I didn't have the connection with Chelly or the fans at EGOIST like I have with Miku and the fans there, Magical Mirai and most Miku concerts just seem to have become events with the same songs you'll hear performed in mostly the same way. The EGOIST concert was unique and special because it was the last show of the first tour and you can see how much it means to EGOIST's fans and Chelly herself.

I should of really gotten the names and details of the guys around me who were awesome, the guy I lent the glowstick to was super thankful and really cheered him up.

Anyway back to the hotel to try sleep, last day tomorrow and I am at TGS.

### Day 11

Typical me really, in all my time at the hotel in Ikebukuro I had never got up in time for breakfast. So anyway I left late as usual and was making my way to Chiba  for the Tokyo Game Show.

Queuing took a while and I was hungry and tired. So by the time I got in I wasn't really wanting to queue for 2hours for Kingdom Hearts 2.5 so I played a couple of indie or less known games. Project Mirai Remix was the main one I played which was nice enough and I got some free stuff for it. I also played a Hack and Slash developed by some university students and Sky Lore which was a MMO published by DMM. Seeing a foreigner able to pick up and play an MMO was either startling to them or they just have to say Amazing and good job to everyone. It pretty much plays the same as most MMOs, look for quest giver, mash action bars, win.

The crowds were also ridiculous as well which I didn't really enjoy too. But I stayed about to watch Yun*Chi perform at the Samsung booth.

She probably thinks I stalk her since she's seen me in London at Hyper Japan before, but with that done I entered the lottery,s to win tissues (Whoo me!) and then headed out on my way to Akihabara for more pizza. I wonder if they recognise me.

I wish I had discovered the pizza place earlier and will be visiting you on a daily basis should I ever go back.

After eating that I mostly went round the streets taking pictures so imagedump incoming:

With that done I went back to my hotel a final time and began to pack (With help from Mum and Grandmother on Skype). Since it was a 6am start and I had to be awake for that.

### Day 12
So with Day 12, I was heading home. I checked out and waited outside for my "Shuttle Bus" to pick me up. I didn't expect a private car to pick me. It was a nice feeling of luxury to be driven to the airport in. With the lovely ride over, I checked in, dropped off my portable wifi and readied myself for the upcoming flight.

I arrived back in England the same day (technically 2 hours ahead of when I left) but I was glad to be back home. I can't really sleep on planes so was drifting in and out sleep which was probably not good and I was once again last off the plane. Going through Immigration and Customs though was a breeze which I was most thankful for. Even more thankful they didn't stop me in Customs since I was bringing a tad more than I was technically allowed. Once through I sat around and waited to be picked up. Of course they were late thanks to traffic on the M25, we're definitely in England all right.

So in total this is all I bought:

Plus Glowsticks and Programmes.

And with all the leaflets and paper my mother was able to make some nice collages:

And with that this post is done. It was a truly special time that I shall never forget. I can't wait to go back whether that be sometime this year or next. I just want to do more, more concerts, actually sightsee and explore properly rather than getting lost, more things to buy and hopefully people to spend the time with. If you're on the fence about the trip do something that will decide for you whether that be coin toss, ticket lottery or something and act on it, you'll be glad and when your standing looking at the Welcome To Japan sign you'll know it's worth it.
