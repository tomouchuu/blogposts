While 2016 may have been a terrible year for the vast majority of things it’s actually been really good for me and I just would like to say some thank yous to some people that have made it what it is.

### Sam
My best friend Sam, who thanks to his recommendation and his pushing me, made me take the leap to changing jobs and I’m so thankful I did. Not only am I on more money, but I work right in the centre of London, made a lot of good friends and learnt a lot of new things. It’s been a great change and going back to my old work for their Christmas party that I was invited to re-enforced that it was good for me. So thank you sam.

### Zac & Nick
The two guys that got me into going to the gym, while I might not do weights currently I go every Saturday morning for circuits to just get fitter in general. As part of my resolutions I’m definitely going to get back into weights as well as circuits and I hope you two continue to support me.

### Karen
It’s been great to hang out and talk about Idols and am looking forward to joining you in Japan in two and a bit weeks. With thanks to you I’ve gotten a bit more involved in the global dempagumi scene and I hope to continue and do more of this in the future.

### Riku
Thanks for making TIF a fantastic experience! With your help I was able to meet Gumi on the first day and with you and a friends suggestion able to redo that chekki to meet her multiple times on the sunday and be frontrow and right in front of their performance at the Ship Stage. It was also nice on the eve of the second night drinking with french guys. Also thanks for the monday visiting HMV/VV was great! I look forward to seeing you again soon!

### JP Dempa wotas (Keitaro, HongKong, MeruKosu)
It was great seeing you all on my trip and hope to see you all again in January! Thank you for making me feel welcome

### Alicia
Thank you for booking the hotel and allowing me to share the room. It was nice to have someone I knew in New York so I didn’t feel alone and it was good to talk. Also thank you for introducing me into the Discord and meeting new momoclo fans.

### The US Mononofu (Aaron, Alberto, Melissa, David, SoCal guys in line)
Thank you for the hospitality in New York, it was nice to go round the city and see some of the sights and for the journey to the airport.

### Mirin (Dempagumi.inc)
Thank you for being the best idol! While the 2 hayabusa dempagumi.inc concerts were just under the high standards I wanted you still did your best and you’ve done really well to promote yourself this year. I hope the budokan concert will be my highlight of 2017 as it is going to be so special for you and me.

### Gumi (Banmon)
Thank you for being amazing this year. You tried your hardest to communicate with me even though english is hard and I’m very happy with the chekkis we took. I hope it made you happy to see how happy I was. While I’m unfortunately just missing out on your release events I hope to see you again soon!

### Momoclo
Rather than just saying to Kananko, I’d like to say to all the momoclo staff thank you. Thank you for tohjinsai which was spectacular, especially 2nd day but also thank you for New York and the US tour.

That’s about it off the top of my head, apologies if forgotten people, but massive thank you to everyone I’ve met this year. Let’s make 2017 even better!
