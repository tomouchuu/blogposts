title: Thoughts on the increasing popularity of Idols in the UK
date: 1st December 2015
---

So since becoming an idol fan sometime in mid-2014 I've noticed that the popularity of Idols has been increasing a bunch. In this post I'll cover why I started to like Idols, why I think the popularity of idols is increasing and finally what I think the future has in store for idol fans in the uk.

## My intro to idols

To set the scene it is mid-2014, I've booked my trip to Japan primarily to see Miku and I noticed a friend on twitter (@socialanimeguy) post a link to say Momoclo, Kyary & Ebichu would be at Kishidan Banpaku. Being a kyary fan, I thought hey that would be awesome so I got tickets for it. I'd say that would be the event that changed my perspectives and opened my eyes to Idol music. Flash forward to the day of the festival, I had enjoyed Ebichu but put them as some random schoolgirl idols (oh how wrong I was). Kyary was fun and the rest of the festival was great, thoughout the day I noticed 2 things. The first, everyone has silly haircuts like Kishidan. The second everyone is wearing momoclo merch and decked out in their favourite members colour. This practice seemed weird but cool at first but began to make sense as Momoclo started, each member's fans would cheer more for their favourite and have specific calls and movements they would do. This type of cheering for a group was basically unheard of by me. I understood there would be general calls (hey, hey, hey) and some basic glowstick waving but the amount of skill displayed by the fans was truely amazing. I think if the fans were similar to how I originally expected I would have probably have not become as big a fan as I have done, I wanted to join with them. After the festival I bought a Momoclo Concert BD and learnt as much as I could hoping to one day be back and with that crowd, cheering on Kanako and enjoying life.

Idol music wasn't completely new to me, I enjoyed anime like THE IDOLM@STER, Love Live & Wake Up Girls and I had watched/listened to enough Vocaloid concerts to understand a bit of idol culture. Like many in the UK, Babymetal was probably my first 'proper' idol experience. I say 'proper' because while they are idols there is a huge crossover with the metal fans in the UK and since we have more metal fans then idol fans, I feel they have altered the perception of babymetal to me.

I somehow ended up finding Dempagumi.inc around the time of their Dempari Night single (Nov/Dec 2014) and instantly fell in love. This was my group, I could listen to any song and enjoy it, and I found all the members down to earth and fun people. Out of the six girls Mirin (red) was my favourite member, she had twintails, a distinctive voice and really enjoyed video games. When I eventually learned the story of WWD I sympathised with her and wanted to support her even more. It was around this time too, a dempa thread appeared on 4chan. I enjoyed speaking to the anons there and made good friends with one, we set up a chatroom and we talked every few days about upcoming news and releases for dempagumi and mirin since we were both mirin supporters.

Moving onto Jan/Feb 2015, Hyper Japan/JPU Records had started doing news posts/teasing a dempa announcement. And at the big dempagumi shows in feb at Yoyogi gymnaisum, the world tour announcement came. London was one of the dates, and I was certain it would be Hyper Japan. That was confirmed a few weeks later. I was hyped already and became even more hyped that the chatroom anon mentioned that some of the Japanese fans would be coming over for the concert. With the concert announcement confirmed I tried to learn all the calls & movements that dempa fans do so I could be ready for the concerts.

## The UK Idol Fan Explosion
### Hyper Japan Summer

So with Hyper Japan came idols acts such as Dempagumi.inc, Tokyo Girls Style, Hiiragi Rio, Honey Spice, Heisei Kotohime. I believe this (& JapanExpo) was what caused the recent surge in idol fans in the UK and specifically the wotaku that were there.

On the friday we had Hiiragi Rio, she was cute and fun and brought some of her fanclub along from Japan. All in all there wasn't too many of us but being my first idol concert and not knowing any of her songs/calls but I think people enjoyed it. Continuing on Friday was the Dempa Q&A session which was packed out, I was pretty impressed thinking it would just be fairly busy.

Onto Saturday, dempa were on early so I met up with the chatroom anon and the JP wotakus to secure our spots. And blimey what a show! I think people seeing a large group of fans doing the calls and movements did the same thing for them as what the momoclo fans did to me back at kishidan. It goes to my thoughts that a good concert is not just made by the group performing but also the crowd too and that crowd + artist feed off each others energy. Thus us wotakus give energy to dempa + crowd, they then give that to the crowd + us. With that concert over, meet & greet was packed out with people.

I truely believe this then has a knock on event as people who were there tell their friends and their friends etc. and everyone has to see the next dempa show on the sunday being the last chance. It's even crazier than the first show and so the knock on effect continues. I'd like to think this is what cause the dramatic increase in fans but it's also comes down to a number of other factors.

### Other factors

With music sales plummeting across the world, record labels need to make their sales to keep themselves and artists afloat. While english music is generally available globally, japanese music is mostly available only in japan and even then is mostly still on CDs. I think with them struggling and seeing the way anime/japanese culture has become cool around the world they've begun to push artists to a global platform. In 2013, Kyary had come to London, followed by PERFUME in 2014 attempting to reach the english markets. I feel these attempts were pretty successful and so other groups are trying to attempt the same. Babymetal have been a pretty amazing success story particularly in the UK too.

With overseas fans interested in idol music then the hardcore of these will import the CDs and if you're lucky merch + concert videos. It's an expensive

Another factor I think would be the collaborations that happened earlier this year such as the momoclo vs kiss & shokotan loves dempa for the anime Punchline.

With idol anime becoming popular, fans of that are being exposed to the real life versions of the groups at concerts in Japan. If people really enjoy seeing that then usually I've found they'll want to see other groups and so they come on that way. Most of the people I know that have are into idol music have come from anime into it.

Lastly it's just happy music most of the time and very very earwormy. You usually end up with a smile and singing along to the songs.

### Hyper Japan Christmas

So with the hyper japan christmas market, Ladybaby were the main idol group and a combination of both general wotaku like myself + babymetal fans + ladybaby wotaku made for a good show. I noticed in the meet & greet on sunday a few of the ladybaby wotaku were mentioning nemu (from dempas) wotaku tutorials and I saw many a dempa seifuku. And I believe the cycle continues, with those shows we've hopefully created some new fans of ladybaby and hopefully wotaku culture in general.

## Future

The main thing that has yet to happen for the UK wotaku scene is a solo show by a group (aside from babymetal). It's hard to do as the group needs to be really popular across all wotakus and even better if some japanese wotas make the trip. There is only one group I can see this happening with and that's momoclo or dempa. With both I'd imagine it would probably be like the momoclo AX concert where it was a separate event but happened during the time AX happened so that as many fans as possible have a reason to go. With dempa I'd say it would be at a venue like Islington or some place in Camden, for momoclo I'd expect them to go straight to shepards bush or hammersmith.

As for which group, kwkm from momoclo's management has said momoclo would be going abroad in 2016 and to more places then north america. That almost certainly means europe to me and then really it's down to London or Paris as for the preference. Japan Expo in france is the bigger of the 2 conventions but my bias thinks London is a nicer city and where the girls would prefer to go. Saying that it is possible both could be done but I'd be worried about spliting fans between the two and resulting in a lesser experience for both (unless momoclo end up in islington in which case may god have mercy)

For Hyper Japan we're heading back to Olympia for the summer show. There isn't a stage setup there so it'll be something they'd have to create (please no chairs) but if the current trend continues I'd expect to see groups like Banmon, Babyraids Japan there as the next big thing and for big group I'd expect a *48 group or the love live girls. I think momoclo are too big to do a performance there (seperate event, maybe some sort of q&a though) and dempa were there last year so I think it would be odd to see them back so soon (wouldn't say no though).

## Outro

Anyway that's another blog post done and another long one, I've probably even missed some points I've forgotten about but I do think Idol culture is certainly on the up in the UK and I don't see any reason for it to slow down. Maybe I can do stuff like this a bit more often now, but yeah until next time!
