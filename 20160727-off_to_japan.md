date: 27th July 2016

So I’m once again off to Japan, this time next week I’ll be somewhere in the sky after my transfer from London City to Frankfurt to Tokyo. I thought I’d do a blog post to outline my schedule.

I leave London City at just before 3pm arriving in Frankfurt at 5:15pmish with approx 2hours to hang around before my flight from Frankfurt at 7:20pm to arrive in Japan at 1:40pm on the 4th August at Narita. From here I plan to swap my railpass voucher and then make my way to the airbnb. Once I’m all settled down, I plan to go out in the evening for food & some shopping, maybe meet up with some people maybe!

Next up I’ve got Tokyo Idol Festival (TIF) for the weekend of 5th, 6th, 7th. You can find my schedule plan here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7SqsE4-4SfpOG11UkJEVk4xc0k?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7SqsE4-4SfpOG11UkJEVk4xc0k?usp=sharing) Basically I plan to see:

* @17, once
* Ayumikurikamaki,twice
* Oyayubi Princess, once
* Okuzawamura, once
* Kamiyado, once
* Kjawano Marina, once
* Cupitron, once

* Lyrical School, three times
* Manekikecak, once
* RuriRori, once
* Rev. from DVL, once
* Rocka Japonica, three times
* Wasuta, three times

Got That? Going to be really busy and likely will miss some of these but that’s my list anyhow. Still waiting on meet and greets, for that I’m aiming for Mirin(dempa), Gumi(banmon), Ano(ylmlm), Iori(moso), Amipon(Rocka Japonica), Perorin(Baseball Girls), Kappi (PassCode) and Ayaka or Mei from Lyrical School. I hope to meet lots of new wota friends and the wotas who came over to London last year for Dempagumi.inc. It’s going to be a lot of fun!

The day after the festival (8/8), I’ve got nothing planned during the day but I’ve seeing PassCode at their Tour Final at Zepp Divercity. Should be a lot of fun seeing that since it’ll be with a live band and tour finals are really great.

Next up I have nothing planned for the 9th & 10th of August. I do plan to go to DisneySea one of those days but I’ve not got it set in stone yet. I hope to go to DisneySea to ride the exclusive rides, see Fantastic and also buy their 15th Anniversary/Summer merchandise.

From the 11th, I kick it into overdrive. Off to Aomori at the top of the main island of Japan to see Dempa on their Hayabusa tour. I’ll be staying at a hotel up there and then travelling down on the 12th to Morioka for Dempa again. At this point I’m not sure whether to head back to Aomori to the hotel or back to Tokyo to the Airbnb. Aomori means I can stay around after the concert later, Tokyo means I can get to Yokohama earlier the next morning.

The reason for Yokohama is I’ll be seeing Momoclo's Tohjinsai concerts at Nissan Stadium on the 13th/14th. I want to get there earlish for merchandise and there are other idol groups performing. Doors is at 2pm with show starting at 5:30pm.

I’ll then be leaving very early on the 15th to sadly head back to the UK. Any times I’ve not mentioned anything above I’m most likely free so give me a buzz ([@tomopagu](https://twitter.com/tomopagu)) and lets do something!
